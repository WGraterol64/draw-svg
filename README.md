## This branch was created in case students have trouble linking reference libs due to architecture incapability. Note there will be a few differences.

* When you switch between your version and reference, you will see the same result which all comes from your implementation. The pixel diff will always be 0.
* You need to implement alpha_blending() starting from task 1, this was originally task 5.
* You need to implement rasterize_line() starting from task 2, this was originally a extra credit.
